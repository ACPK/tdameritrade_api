# TDAmeritradeApi (alpha)

This is a gem for connecting to the TD Ameritrade API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'tdameritrade_api', :git=>'https://github.com/wakproductions/tdameritrade_api.git'

## Important Note

This is in the very early stages of development and intended for Winston's personal use. It has very limited
functionality in comparison to the entirety of the API. See the /vendor/docs folder for more details on the
overall API.
